This is a walkthrough of the CTF machine "Stapler" on [Vulnhub](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/stapler-1,150/). This is a great machine for practicing enumeration :)


 
      ****Spoiler Alert****          ****Spoiler Alert****



Let's jump all in with an extended TCP Nmap scan (nmap -A recommended, but too much info to list here):

Wow, ports a-plenty! For these CTF machines this result is always bittersweet since that's just that much more possible dead ends. For brevity here, I'll list some of the avenues I followed here:
	
1. FTP. Anonymous logins worked, with some banner info and a note. Local usernames gained, but no other foothold.
2. SSH. I don't like trying Hydra, Medusa, or other crackers this early so I opted not to try brute forcing any logins just yet for either this service or any others.
3. DNS. Nothing exploitable from the dnsmasq version that I could gather that would be beneficial to this CTF.
4. NTP. Not much here unless I was interested in DoS.
5. NetBios. Running enum4linux garnered all of the other local usernames. This would have been a great time for a brute-force event, however I still wanted to probe a bit deeper first.
6. Doom/666. This service ended up extracting to a JPG file containing another note/username.
7. MySQL. I did not enumerate this service at all seeing as I had other services to occupy my time. Had one of those options fell through I would have focused on this avenue more.

After this quick runthrough I was left with 80 & 12380. The typical web port brought me to an unfinished page, and scanning it with Nikto showed that .profile and .bashrc were available so perhaps this was being served by a local profile?

Setting this aside I went looking at 12380:

Nice looking, but not much here either or in the source, other than another note (this seems to be quite the chatty bunch). Let's run it through Nikto:

Much more info to go on and this is how rabbit holes get dug but following the path of least resistence here, we can see a few directories that need further exploration:
- admin112233
- blogblog
- phpmyadmin

We also see something else of interest. An SSL certificate (with of course a note). So we'll add HTTPS as a vector to these directories.
- admin112233 - Tester for BEEF toolkit.
- blogblog - Wordpress page for Initech - Down the Rabbit Hole we go!
- phpmyadmin - Standard PHPMyAdmin page.

It looks like John is the main admin on this page, but no other interesting details are being given. Let's use wpscan to find some additional details about the site:
