I've had [Brainpan](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/brainpan-1,51/) downloaded for awhile and for some reason I haven't ran it, so having a couple of hours last night I decided to see what it was all about. Unbeknownst to me, it was exactly what I was needing...

I had been wanting to practice buffer overflows for my upcoming OSCP test, and have been working on getting Windows machine setup just for this running [vulnserver](https://github.com/stephenbradshaw/vulnserver) or something similar.

Err, ok. A little on the nose here huh? The source shows that this is only an infographic image being hosted.  
Let's hit TCP/9999 with NetCat and see what that's all about:

Hmm, not much here either. We need more info. Let's go back to the web service and enumerate further using Nikto.
