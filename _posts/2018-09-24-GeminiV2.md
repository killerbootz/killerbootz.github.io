This is a walkthrough of the CTF machine "Gemini2" on [Vulnhub](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/gemini-inc-2,234/). A tough VM, with lots of learning potential!


 
      ****Spoiler Alert****          ****Spoiler Alert****



I seem to always be doing these CTFs in reverse order. I'll be going back to do GeminiV1 after this, but for me this was very challenging and fun. I learned from both a web application and privilege escalation perspective as this one seemed to be very real-world based. So let's get going!


![GeminiV2 NmapOutput]({{ site.url }}/images/GeminiV2/nmap.JPG)

The Nmap output looks to be limited to only SSH and HTTP, so let's see what the webpage is serving up.

![GeminiV2 BasePage]({{ site.url }}/images/GeminiV2/base_page.JPG)

Ok, so we have a page with uses that are apparently locked to an authenticated session (i.e. export of the profile, accessing the user list etc.). What about Nikto?

![GeminiV2 Nikto]({{ site.url }}/images/GeminiV2/nikto.JPG)

Wah-wah. Not really that useful. I was getting similar results using dirb, and using a longer wordlist was taking too long, so I switched to dirbuster (GUI) and found some interesting files:

![GeminiV2 Register]({{ site.url }}/images/GeminiV2/register.JPG)  

I'm not really seeing any other angles of attack at the moment, so let's head on over to regisration.php and see if we can register a user:

![GeminiV2 Registration]({{ site.url }}/images/GeminiV2/registration.JPG) 

The registration process here is simple until we're hit with:

![GeminiV2 Register_Noactivate]({{ site.url }}/images/GeminiV2/register_noactivate.JPG)

What's great is that at least we're given the type and length of code we're expected to have ("6 digit").  
So first off I wanted to create a database of every possible 6 digit code combination. Crunch is a great tool for that, and didn't take more than a couple of seconds to run and create:

![GeminiV2 Activate_Dic]({{ site.url }}/images/GeminiV2/crunch.JPG)

Next, I need to find a way to "feed" these one at a time to the activation form. Let's look at the activation request in Burp Suite to see what we're dealing with:

![GeminiV2 Activate_Req]({{ site.url }}/images/GeminiV2/activate_request.JPG)

So, it looks like we're going to have a CSRF token to contend with here. With an incorrect activation code, we recieve a "403 INVALID VALUE" response from the server (as seen below):

![GeminiV2 Activate_Res]({{ site.url }}/images/GeminiV2/activate_response.JPG)

To get started I exported the original POST request I had in Burp, as a Curl command. From that point I was a bit stumped and truely was not sure how to bypass the CSRF token. I ended up watching a bit of the walkthough from the creator of this [CTF](https://scriptkidd1e.wordpress.com/geminiinc-v2-virtual-machine-walkthrough/) I was pleased to see him perform the exact same Curl export that I was stumped on, so when I saw him grep the token, I knew that was what I was missing, stopped the walkthough and finished the script I had began:

![GeminiV2 CSRF_Bypass]({{ site.url }}/images/GeminiV2/CSRF_Bypass_activate.JPG)  

Is this script ugly. Oh yeah. Does it work? You bet. I echo'd the token and code just to ensure both were random for each request. Running the request through Burp made searching for the correct code extremely easy, as I was looking for the only non-403 value present:
