This is a walkthrough of the CTF machine "Gemini2" on [Vulnhub](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/gemini-inc-2,234/). A tough VM, with lots of learning potential!

I seem to always be doing these CTFs in reverse order. I'll be going back to do GeminiV1 after this, but for me this was very challenging and fun. I learned from both a web application and privilege escalation perspective as this one seemed to be very real-world based. So let's get going!

The Nmap output looks to be limited to only SSH and HTTP, so let's see what the webpage is serving up.
