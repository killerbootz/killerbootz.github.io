This is a walkthrough of the CTF machine "Bulldog2" on [Vulnhub](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/bulldog-2,246/). For me this was a challenging VM to beat! I like one's like these because they challenge me while still being enjoyable.

So after initial bootup we grab the IP and perform the obligatory nmap scan:

Looks like slim pickings with a single website. Let's take a look at Bulldog.social:

Nice. Another social media site selling data to vendors. 
If we look at the source we see that the site references several JavaScript files. The "main" one looks interesting as it references several functions and even paths that Nikto and Dirb didn't find. From this we're able to find the path to extract all of Bulldog.social users:

http://x.x.x.x/users/getUsers?limit= 

Unfortunately, no passwords were included in the output. No problem, if we run the login process through Burp Suite we have the option to copy as a Curl command. From that I was able to piece together a very dirty "quick crack" script:

Since we're getting JSON output back on failed authentications as "false", searching the output for any "true" indicators will result in a successful authentication. After only a few changes of password, we have a winner:
