This is a walkthrough of the CTF machine "Bulldog2" on [Vulnhub](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/bulldog-2,246/). For me this was a challenging VM to beat! I like one's like these because they challenge me while still being enjoyable.

****Spoiler Alert**** ****Spoiler Alert**** ****Spoiler Alert ****

So after initial bootup we grab the IP and perform the obligatory nmap scan:

![Bulldog2 NmapOutput]({{ site.url }}/images/Bulldog2/nmap.JPG)

Looks like slim pickings with a single website. Let's take a look at Bulldog.social:

![Bulldog2 Page]({{ site.url }}/images/Bulldog2/page.JPG)

Nice. Another social media site selling data to vendors. 
If we look at the source we see that the site references several JavaScript files. The "main" one looks interesting as it references several functions and even paths that Nikto and Dirb didn't find. From this we're able to find the path to extract all of Bulldog.social users:

http://x.x.x.x/users/getUsers?limit= 

Unfortunately, no passwords were included in the output. No problem, if we run the login process through Burp Suite we have the option to copy as a Curl command. From that I was able to piece together a very dirty "quick crack" script:

![Bulldog2 QuickCrack]({{ site.url }}/images/Bulldog2/quickcrack_script.JPG)

Since we're getting JSON output back on failed authentications as "false", searching the output for any "true" indicators will result in a successful authentication. After only a few changes of password, we have a winner:

![Bulldog2 CrackedUser]({{ site.url }}/images/Bulldog2/crackeduser.JPG)

So upon logging into the horochette account with the password we specified in the Curl script previously we weren't really presented with much to work with, or were we? Looking back at the image above we can see we have a few pices of info. A token (JWT), and some other identifying pieces of information on the user, in addition to the users "auth_level".

I knew I had seen this somewhere before and sure enough, going back to the main JavaScript file and searching it we can see the following:

![Bulldog2 MasterAdmin]({{ site.url }}/images/Bulldog2/masteradmin.JPG)


So why not try to change it via FireBug?

![Bulldog2 ChangeToAdmin]({{ site.url }}/images/Bulldog2/changetoadmin.JPG)

Once we refresh, we are presented with a new "Admin" option. WoHoo!

![Bulldog2 AdminPanel]({{ site.url }}/images/Bulldog2/adminpanel.JPG)

....With a separate authentication dialog  ಠ╭╮ಠ

Ok, so I can tell the authentication is happening against /users/linkauthenticate, and origincally I figured I would try to reverse my Curl script from above. I plugged a static "admin" user and set it to run against a common password dictionary. I noticed that I was getting a ton of errors so upon taking a look at the output I noticed this:

![Bulldog2 RevCurlErr]({{ site.url }}/images/Bulldog2/revcurlerrors.JPG)

Errors are always useful in some way, and here I can tell that the full name of the installation is "Bulldog-2-The-Reckoning". Not having much else to go on here, and after trying multiple other brute force attempts I tried Googleing that name. This led to the Github repo of what appeared to be the same site. Great, looking at the source for the "linkauthenticate" dialogue showed the following:

![Bulldog2 Linkauth]({{ site.url }}/images/Bulldog2/linkauth.JPG)

So from here I could tell that there is no input validation and that the use of "exec" meant that I should be able to perform command injection. What I didn't realize at the time was that this was basically blind command injection. Nor did I really know what the correct escape syntax was. Because this is a learning process I don't feel bad about looking at a separate walkthough for this. 
I took a look at [Bernie Lim's walkthough](https://hackso.me/bulldog-2-walkthrough/ "The Reckoning") and found what I was missing, although my take was a little different.

I created a script with a Bash reverse shell instruction and saved it to my web directory in Kali, and started Apache. Then started my NetCat listener and ran through the following commands, each time receiving nothing but an incorrect login:
