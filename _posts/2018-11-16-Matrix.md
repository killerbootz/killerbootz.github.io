This is a walkthrough of the Intermediate machine "Matrix" on [Vulnhub](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/matrix-1,259/). Let's take the red pill and see where this story goes....


 
      ****Spoiler Alert****          ****Spoiler Alert****



So one of the scripts I run includes what I label as a "shotgun" option, and is essentially __nmap -A__. Running it here gives the following output:  

![MTX_Nmap]({{ site.url }}/images/Matrix/nmap.JPG) 

This shows a typical OpenSSH server with non-typical Python SimpleHTTPServer modules running under ports 80 and 31337. Let's look at these one at a time.

****80**** 

![MTX_80]({{ site.url }}/images/Matrix/80_web.JPG) 

This site is pretty cool looking and if we expand it out, we see a small white rabbit centered at the bottom. No source code elements seem to be hidden. If we choose to save the image for further inspection (because it's just weird it being there right?), we see the name of the file __p0rt_31337.png__. Ok, so we're gently being directed to the next web instance. 

****31337****

![MTX_31337]({{ site.url }}/images/Matrix/31337_web.JPG) 

I previously ran Nikto and dirb on both of these sites and did not come up with much other that both pretty much used the same directory structure, and of course Python module for hosting. No fancy exploits found so let's see if we can find anything in the source for this page.


![MTX_Message]({{ site.url }}/images/Matrix/31337_message.JPG) 

Ok, nothing else is blaring out, but this looks interesting, and anything worth encoding is worth decoding so let's see what we have:

![MTX_Decode]({{ site.url }}/images/Matrix/31337_message_decode.JPG) 

Nice, we have a clue. It looks like there may be a __Cypher.matrix__ file available. Sure enough it was available to save under our page.  
Great, now all we need to do is view the file, extract it, may be pull some strings....
