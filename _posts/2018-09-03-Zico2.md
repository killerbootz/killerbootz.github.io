For me this was a sleeper of a CTF. I had the box right up to a low privilege shell in a matter of minutes, but popping a shell and escalating from there took much longer than I anticipated. It was a very informative and fun VM. Let's get to crack'n!

Initial Nmap shows HTTP, SSH, & RPC:

![Bulldog2 NmapOutput]({{ site.url }}/images/Zico2/nmap.JPG)

Let's see what's showing up on HTTP:

![Bulldog2 Base]({{ site.url }}/images/Zico2/base_page.JPG)

Zico's Shop? Looks ? Questionable...  
So looking at the source here shows us the following:  
![Bulldog2 Source]({{ site.url }}/images/Zico2/basepage_source_lfi.JPG)  

Let's see if view.php is susceptible to a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability here:  
![Bulldog2 LFI]({{ site.url }}/images/Zico2/lfi.JPG)  

Bingo! Although this appeared to be just one vulnerability that had to be chained to another to exploit this system. Let's ennumerate a little more using Nikto & Directory Buster:  
![Bulldog2 Nikto]({{ site.url }}/images/Zico2/nikto.JPG)
![Bulldog2 Dirb]({{ site.url }}/images/Zico2/dirb.JPG)  

Ok, dirb gave us quite a bit here to take a look at.
