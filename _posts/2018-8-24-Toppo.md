This is a walkthrough of the CTF machine "Toppo" on [Vulnhub](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/toppo-1,245/). It's an easy machine so I thought that would make a good first post here :)

A short visit to the site on port 80 reveals a no frills blog, so we run Nikto for some additional information:

An admin directory with indexing enabled could be interesting. Upon browsing to that path a single notes.txt was available for viewing:
