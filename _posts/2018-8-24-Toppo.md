This is a walkthrough of the CTF machine "Toppo" on [Vulnhub](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/toppo-1,245/). It's an easy machine so I thought that would make a good first post here :)

****Spoiler Alert**** 

So after an nmap -A we get the following output:
![Toppo NmapOutput]({{ site.url }}/images/Toppo/nmapout.JPG)


A short visit to the site on port 80 reveals a no frills blog, so we run Nikto for some additional information:
![Toppo NmapOutput]({{ site.url }}/images/Toppo/nikto.JPG)

An admin directory with indexing enabled could be interesting. Upon browsing to that path a single notes.txt was available for viewing:

![Toppo NmapOutput]({{ site.url }}/images/Toppo/dirbrowsingnote.JPG)

Well then. A password is half the battle. Presumably this will work for logging into the open SSH we saw earlier but what is the username?

![Toppo NmapOutput]({{ site.url }}/images/Toppo/sshteduser.JPG)

Yup, not much imagination but there it is. 

So, on to PrivEsc! Starting out with the usual let's see what we have by way of programs with SUID set:

![Toppo NmapOutput]({{ site.url }}/images/Toppo/stderr denied.JPG)

Ok, so we won't be able to direct stderr to /dev/nul, so let's try another path:

![Toppo NmapOutput]({{ site.url }}/images/Toppo/stderrworkaround.JPG)

Ahh, there ya go. And good'ole Python. Let's see if we can jump to a privileged shell from this guy:

![Toppo NmapOutput]({{ site.url }}/images/Toppo/pythontoPTY_BashvsBourne.jpg)

Yup, in case you can't make it out in the picture I'm spawning "/bin/sh" vs "/bin/bash" (Bourne over Bash). 

Let's grab our flag and get some coffee:
