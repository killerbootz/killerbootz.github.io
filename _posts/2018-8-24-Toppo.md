This is a walkthrough of the CTF machine "Toppo" on [Vulnhub](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/toppo-1,245/). It's an easy machine so I thought that would make a good first post here :)

So after an nmap -A we get the following output:
![Toppo NmapOutput]({{ site.url }}/images/Toppo/nmapout.JPG)


A short visit to the site on port 80 reveals a no frills blog, so we run Nikto for some additional information:
![Toppo NmapOutput]({{ site.url }}/images/Toppo/nikto.JPG)

An admin directory with indexing enabled could be interesting. Upon browsing to that path a single notes.txt was available for viewing:

![Toppo NmapOutput]({{ site.url }}/images/Toppo/dirbrowsingnote.JPG)

Well then. A password is half the battle. Presumably this will work for logging into the open SSH we saw earlier but what is the username?

![Toppo NmapOutput]({{ site.url }}/images/Toppo/sshteduser.JPG)

Yup, not much imagination but there it is.
